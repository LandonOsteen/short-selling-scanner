Check these console logs when the alert fires:

1. After "Already fired? false", you should see:
   - "âœ… Alert marked as fired"
   - "ðŸ”” FIRING ALERT to X callback(s)..."
   - "ðŸ“ž Calling callback 1..."
   - "âœ… Callback 1 completed successfully"
   - "ðŸ“¨ Received new alert: ..." (from App.tsx)

2. If you DON'T see these logs, the fireAlert function is failing silently.

Please check your browser console for the COMPLETE output.
